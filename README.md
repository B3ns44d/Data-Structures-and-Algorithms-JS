In this repo, I will talk about some common data structures and algorithms and I will implement them using JavaScript

## stack
The stack is considered LIFO (Last In First Out) — meaning the last item you put in the stack is the first item that comes out of the stack, let's take an example If you stack books, the top book will be taken before the bottom one. Or when you browse on the internet, the back button leads you to the most recently browsed page.

**Take a look at the [Stack.js](https://github.com/B3ns44d/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-JS/blob/master/Stacks.js) function**

## Sets

The set data structure stores values without any particular order and with no repeated values. Besides being able to add and remove elements to a set, there are a few other important set functions that work with two sets at once.

-   Union — This combines all the items from two different sets and returns this as a new set (with no duplicates).
-   Intersection — Given two sets, this function returns another set that has all items that are part of both sets.
-   Difference — This returns a list of items that are in one set but NOT in a different set.
-   Subset — This returns a boolean value that shows if all the elements in one set are included in a different set.
